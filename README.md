# urban-network-analysis

This repository contains the source code for the research article [The 15-minute city in the Urban South: modeling spatial accessibility and measuring social equity across seven major Iranian cities]() published in the Journal of Urban Mobility. With this code in hand, you will be able to automatically (1) retrieve Point of Interests (POIs) from OpenStreetMap (OSM), (2) assign them into eight different amenity categories, including education, entertainment, grocery, health, posts and banks, parks, sustenance, and shops, and then (3) compute walking time from every network node (orgin) to the nearest POI in each category types. Overall, using *final_version.ipynb*, you can develop your own 15-minute framework for any city worldwide,  simply provide an appropriate CRS and assign a city name in predefined locations. To showcase your final result(s), you can also use this *Pydeck_15MinC_Tehran.ipynb* to allow potential users to engage with maps in an interactive environment.
