This repository contains the source code for the research article [The 15-minute city in the Urban South: modeling spatial accessibility and measuring social equity across seven major Iranian cities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667091725000640) published in the Journal of Urban Mobility. With this code in hand, you will be able to automatically (1) retrieve Point of Interests (POIs) from OpenStreetMap (OSM), (2) assign them into eight different amenity categories, including education, entertainment, grocery, health, posts and banks, parks, sustenance, and shops, and then (3) compute walking time from every network node (orgin) to the nearest POI in each category types. Overall, using `final_version.ipynb`, you can develop your own 15-minute framework for any city worldwide,  simply provide an appropriate CRS and assign a city name in predefined locations. To showcase your final result(s), you can also use this `Pydeck_15MinC_Tehran.ipynb` to allow potential users to engage with maps in an interactive environment.

abstract = "Parks and other green spaces are an important part of sustainable, healthy and socially equal urban environment. Urban planning and green space management benefit from information about green space use and values, but such data are often scarce and laborious to collect. Temporally dynamic geographic information generated by different mobile devices and social media platforms are a promising source of data for studying green spaces. User-generated data have, however, platform specific characteristics that limit their potential use. In this article, we compare the ability of different user-generated data sets to provide information on where, when and how people use and value urban green spaces. We compare four types of data: social media, sports tracking, mobile phone operator and public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) data in a case study from Helsinki, Finland. Our results show that user-generated geographic information sources provide useful insights about being in, moving through and perceiving urban green spaces, as long as evident limitations and sample biases are acknowledged. Social media data highlight patterns of leisure time activities and allow further content analysis. Sports tracking data and mobile phone data capture green space use at different times of the day, including commuting through the parks. PPGIS studies allow asking specific questions from active participants, but might be limited in spatial and temporal extent. Combining information from multiple user-generated data sets complements traditional data sources and provides a more comprehensive understanding of green space use and preferences."
